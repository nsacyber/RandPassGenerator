RandPassGenerator 1.3.4

The RandPassGenerator Java application is a simple command-line utility for generating random passwords, passphrases, and raw hex keys.  It is designed very conservatively to ensure that the random values it provides offer full cryptographic strength requested by the user.  This text file describes how to build the RandPassGenerator from source code. 

DEPENDENCIES

To build RandPassGenerator from source, you will need:
   
1. Oracle Java SDK (J2SE), version 1.9 or later  [Java 9]
   
2. Apache Ant   [The version that comes with J2SE is ok]

BUILD PROCEDURE

The procedure below works for Windows, Linux, and most other platforms.  Each step includes Linux commands as an example.

Step 1 - create a directory in which to perform the build

       	% mkdir randpassgen

Step 2 - Unpack the source code from the Zip file "src.zip" into the directory you created in step 1.

	% cd randpassgen
	% unzip ../src.zip

Step 3 - Ensure that you can run the Java compiler and the Ant build utility.
	     
	% javac -version
	% ant -version
	 
If either of these fails, then fix your Java installation and PATH settings before going on step 4.


Step 4 - Build the RandPassGenerator runnable Jar file, by running Ant with the target "jar".
	     
	% ant jar
	 
If the Ant process concludes with anything other than "BUILD SUCCESSFUL", there's something wrong with Java or	Ant.  Fix these before going on to step 5.


Step 5 - Test the RandPassGenerator with a simple generation task, using the options shown below.

	% java -jar build/jar/PassGenerator.jar -v -str 128 -k 7


UNIT TESTING

All important classes have simple unit test support.  To run the unit test, simply execute that class from the build/classes directory.
For example, to test the CharacterSet class, you can run it like this:

% cd build/classes
	     
% java gov.nsa.ia.gen.CharacterSet

Some of the unit tests require a command-line argument; if you run it without an argument but one is required, then you'll get an error message.  

For example:
     	     
% cd build/classes
	     
% java gov.nsa.ia.gen.WordSet
	     ...
	     WARNING: WordSet test - no URL given
	     INFO: Please supply the URL of a word dictionary file
	     % java gov.nsa.ia.gen.WordSet file:///usr/share/dict/words
